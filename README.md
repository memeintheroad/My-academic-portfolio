# My-academic-portfolio
A collection of professional projects developed during my **Cybersecurity** studies at Onaizah Colleges, focusing on data protection, database architecture, and threat analysis.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 1.  Encryption & Decryption Tool using python 
* **Concept:** A practical security application designed to ensure data confidentiality and integrity using symmetric cryptography.
* **Technical Details:** * Implemented the **Fernet algorithm (AES-based)** using the Python `cryptography` library.
    * Features include secure **Key Generation**, encryption of plaintext into ciphertext, and seamless decryption.
    * Verified successful results through VS Code terminal testing.
* **Skills:** Python, Cryptography (Symmetric Encryption), Data Integrity, Security Implementation.
* **Files:** [Technical Paper](./Encryption_and_Decryption_Tool_Using_Python_(1).docx) | [Presentation](./Encryption_and_Decryption_Tool_using_Python_presentation.pdf)

### 2. Database Design online shopping Platform (SHEIN Beauty)
* **Concept:** Building a robust relational database schema to manage backend operations for an online shopping platform.
* **Technical Details:** * Developed using **Oracle 19c** following the full database development lifecycle.
    * Designed an **ER Diagram (ERD)** with 6 core entities (Users, Products, Orders, Categories, Subcategories, Reviews).
    * Implemented complex **SQL queries (DDL/DML)**, including table joins and subqueries to extract business insights (e.g., top-rated products).
* **Skills:** SQL, Database Normalization, ERD Design, Oracle 19c.
* **Files:** [Full Report](./_PDatabase_Design_for_Online_Shopping_Platform_(SHEIN_-_Beauty_Items)..pdf) | [Presentation](./Database_Design_for_Online_Shopping_Platform_(SHEIN_-_Beauty_Items)..pdf)

### 3. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in modern cybersecurity
* **Concept:** Strategic research on transforming security from reactive to proactive using Threat Intelligence.
* **Technical Details:** * Analyzed the three levels of CTI: **Strategic** (Planning), **Tactical** (TTPs), and **Operational** (Actionable indicators).
    * Focused on the integration of CTI within **SIEM systems** to reduce false alarms and accelerate incident response.
* **Skills:** Threat Analysis, Risk Mitigation, CTI Lifecycle, Security Strategy.
